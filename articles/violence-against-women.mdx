### Introduction and historical context

In the 19th century, many countries in South America experienced decades of civil war and political upheaval, during which time the governing bodies committed countless human rights violations. For the women in these countries, this often meant being subjected to acts of sexual violence. One example of this is during the Peruvian government�s conflict with the Shining Path in the 1980s when the state was responsible for 88% of all sexually violent crimes with the most prevelant acts committed by the army being rape (32%) and gang rape (18%). Similar statistics can be seen in other countries that experienced prolonged periods of civil unrest. While such blatant state pepetrations of sexual violence are not as common in the modern era, there are still many ways states condone sexual violence against women. 

The main way modern governments play a part in facilitating acts of sexual violence is through their law codes. In many Latin American countries, the laws pertaining to sexual assualt alternate between being too vague or overly explicit, thus making it difficult for victims to get justice. As well, many have Esturpros which are provisions that provide lesser penalties to men who rape young girls, usually between the ages of 14 and 18. As well, these countries are shown to have huge problems with domestic violence with many women and children being trapped in unsafe environments. Luckily, in the past few decades there have been movements within these countries which not only provide assistance to women affected by sexual violence and domestic violence, but also push governments to revise their laws and create out reach programs so that women can leave these harmful situations.

### Source One: State-Perpetrated Wartime Sexual Violence in Latin America

This dissertation explores the ways state militaries utalise sexual violence when engaged in conflicts with counterinsurgent groups. Particularly it focuses on the periods of civil war in Peru during the 1980s and in El Salvador from 1978 to 1992 and the human rights violations that occurred during these conflicts. It breaks down the types of sexual violence that were most common during these regimes as well as which branches of the regime were most likely to commit such acts. It also links the use of this form of violence to the conflict between the governments and counterinsurgent groups, showing how the highest rates of sexual violence occurred when the counterisurgents were at a low to moderate power level and decreased when the counterisurgents grew powerful enough to warrant lethal methods. The dissertation also discusses how acts of sexual violence were more likely to occur alongside other acts of state repressions such as torture or kidnapping

### Source Two: Sepur Zarco Case: The Guatemalan Women Who Rose For Justice in a War-torn Nation

This article from United Nations focuses on the systematic rape and enslavement of the indigenous women of a community near the Sepur Zarco military outpost during the Guatemalan Civil War. First off, this case study another example of state perpetrated sexual violence, with the military raping these women in retaliation of indigenous leaders in the area trying to get legal rights over their land. It also shows how difficult it was, and continues to be, for women to get justice. These crimes occurred in the late 1900s and yet it was not until 2011 four of the survivors got their case to the highest court in the country. Even then, it took five years and twenty two hearings before two former military officers were convicted for crimes against humanity, and the survivors and their communities were granted eighteen reparations. It was the first time that a national court had prosecuted sexual slavery that had happened during a conflict.

### Source Three: Failure To Protect: How Discriminatory Sexual Violence Laws And Practices Are Hurting Women, Girls, And Adolescent In The Americas

This 2021 report by the international human rights organization Equality Now discusses how legal codes can reduce protection from sexual violence for women and girls as well as make it more difficult for them to get justice. It lists per country the different provisions regarding and the associated penalties as well as the additional elements of violence that must be present in order to be considered rape. It also provides links to specific laws within each country that pertain to sexual violence. Other problems addressed in the report include failures to prosecute marital rape, statute of limitations and failure to implement certain laws. While the report focuses on the Americas as a whole and not specifically Latin America, it does include many first-person testimonies and specific pieces of evidence/statistics from different Latin American countries. As well, the writers are transparent about where their data came from, clearly laying out how the research was conducted and how they came to the conclusions they did. Overall, this document provides a good overview of the problems facing victims of sexual violence and is a good start point for those looking into the subject.

### Source Four: Covid-19 Global Gender Response Tracker: Factsheet: Latin America and the Caribbean 

This document is an overview of how governments in Latin America and the Caribbean are addressing threats to gender inequality which have been exacerbated by Covid 19. These threats include an increase in violence, unpaid work and economic insecurity brought on by job loss. While it also touches on the Caribbean, the fact sheet rpovides specific examples of measures taken by individual countries within Latin America regarding both violence against women and girls, and their economic security. It also does a mini case study on Argentina. Like the above source, this fact sheet is a good starting point for one�s research as it gives an overview of the situation while also providing specific examples ?

Source Five: Violence Against Women in Latin America and the Carribean This report by the Pan American Health Organization is an analysis of population based data from 12 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Uraguay. The writers used data collected from thousands of women from thirteen different surveys and discussed not only how the surveys were designed but also the reason behind using each one. From the data collected the report concluded that in the countries studied, one fourth to one half of women experienced domestic abuse. The report then goes on to eleborate on what types and frequencies were most common as well as what factors increase a woman�s risk of experiencing domestic violence. It concludes by giving recommendations for further areas of study as well as for policies and programs that countries should put in place. In all, this source provides a clear and thorough look at the statistical data surrounding domestic violence in Latin America and the Caribbean.
